# Town-of-Salem-Vet-sim
Simulation to figure out if alerting n1 makes sense without a bait in ranked.

We assume here that Jailor has claimed d1 and all Spies, Escorts, TPs and Lookouts will visit him. 
We also assume that trans doesn't trans himself, we ignore the effect of witch controlling townies into vet and we assume both RMs visit somebody who isn't jailor.
We also ignore the effect of roleblocks, wether by jailor or other roles. The results seem to imply that these edge cases don't change much about the fundamental argument.
